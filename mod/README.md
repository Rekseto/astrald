# Modules

Modules are optional extensions of the core functionality of `astrald`.
They are compiled into the node and have full access to the node's internals.
They should only be used for extending low-level functionality of the node.

### Core modules

### Enabled modules

By default, all compiled modules are enabled. To manually select which modules
should be enabled, add the following to `node.yaml` in your
[config directory](../docs/quickstart.md#config-directory):

```yaml
modules:
  - admin
  - apphost
  - ...
```
